"""Stage 05 second opinion — EasyOCR cross-engine disagreement.

CLAUDE.md non-negotiable: cross-engine disagreement is a SECOND, independent
uncertainty trigger. Tesseract stays the sole text + confidence source; EasyOCR
only sets ``Word.engine_disagree`` (never the text, never the confidence — no
reliable word boxes, hallucination risk).

**Why the alignment is token-sequence-level, not box-IoU.** EasyOCR's ``readtext``
returns line/phrase polygons with *concatenated* text (one region ≈ one line,
up to ~15 words), NOT word boxes. So we cannot IoU-match EasyOCR boxes to
Tesseract words. Instead: group Tesseract words into the EasyOCR line region that
spatially contains them, x-sort them (Tesseract's block word-ORDER must not
masquerade as a text disagreement), and diff the two token sequences with
``difflib``. Only ``replace`` opcodes are candidates:

  - a pure ``delete`` is as likely EasyOCR under-detection as a Tesseract error;
  - an ``insert`` has no Tesseract word to mark.

**The dictionary gate — the load-bearing precision filter (see RESULTS.md,
2026-07-18).** A raw token-diff was MEASURED on real Cyrillic (bg_01) to flag
89/763 words (11.7%) — precision ≈ 0. The cause: on Cyrillic, EasyOCR is the
*noisier* reader (it emits Latin homoglyphs — ``се``→``ce``, ``а``→``a`` — and
its own misreads ``които``→``конто``), so raw disagreement surfaces EASYOCR's
errors, not Tesseract's. Edit distance can't separate a real 1-char Tesseract
misread (``Chapmarked``→``Chopmarked``) from 1-char homoglyph noise — both are
single substitutions. The tiebreaker is a per-language dictionary:

    flag a Tesseract word iff  norm(T) ∉ dict  AND  EasyOCR proposed a norm(E) ∈ dict

i.e. flag only when Tesseract produced a NON-word and EasyOCR nominated a VALID
word in its place. This subsumes homoglyph-folding and join-tolerance in one
principled filter (``се`` ∈ dict → never flagged, whatever EasyOCR read). On
bg_01 it collapses 89 → ~7, and the survivors are genuine misreads
(``касалница``→``касапница``, ``Делеагач``→``Дедеагач``).

Honest blind spot: ``norm(T) ∉ dict AND norm(E) ∉ dict`` is a MISS (both
non-words — a domain term, or a rare word absent from the lexicon). That is an
accepted recall loss traded for precision, correct when raw precision is ≈ 0.

**Inert-seam contract (repo pattern, mirrors ``stage08.join_hyphen``).** The gate
NEEDS a per-language lexicon, which does not yet exist in the repo (it is the same
dependency the de-hyphenation seam waits on). With ``dictionary is None`` the
trigger flags NOTHING — the mechanism is built + unit-tested but stays inert until
the owner supplies a lexicon (see config ``engines.easyocr.lexicon``). Stage 05
therefore does not even load EasyOCR when no lexicon is present (its second pass
would produce nothing — wasted GPU).

**Region-confidence gate.** EasyOCR emits its own junk (e.g. conf 0.09 ``'L='``
against a perfect Tesseract ``'a'``@96). Regions below ``min_region_conf`` are
ignored so the second engine's unreliable reads can't nominate an alternative.
This does NOT contradict CLAUDE.md's "independent of raw confidence" rule — that
rule is about ignoring *Tesseract's* confidence; gating on the *second* engine's
own reliability is correct.
